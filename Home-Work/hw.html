<h1>Diaspora</h1>

<p>Diaspora is when many people leave their home country and move to another one. They might leave because of problems in their country or because they want to go. There are lots of reasons for diaspora. Some people leave because of wars, conflicts, or disasters. Others go because they want a better life or more opportunities. Religion, globalization, and jobs can also cause diaspora.</p>


<p>The Jewish people were one of the first groups to leave their homeland in history. They were followed by others, like the Aryans who went to India from Europe a long time ago. In 1947, many people moved between India and Pakistan when those countries were formed. Recently, Rohingyas from Myanmar have come to Bangladesh to find safety.</p>

<p>People often move to places like the UK, the US, or Canada for better lives. But sometimes, countries don’t want diaspora because it can be hard for them to support lots of new people. To stop diaspora, leaders need to work on preventing problems and making life better for everyone.</p>


<h1>Folk Music</h1>

<p>Folk music is a type of music that comes from regular people in a place and is passed down through generations. It’s not fancy or complex because it’s sung by everyday folks, not professional musicians. In Bangladesh, we have many types of folk music like Bhatiyali, Bhawaiya, Baul, and spiritual songs. These songs are about things like love, nature, and rural life.</p>


<p>Some famous singers who contributed to folk music in Bangladesh are Lalan Shah, SirajSai, and Hason Raja. Different tribes in Bangladesh, like the Santal and Garo, also influence folk music. Folk songs often talk about social issues like poverty and inequality, as well as things beyond our everyday world.</p>

<p>Sadly, many people are forgetting about these traditional songs, even though they’re an important part of our culture. Folk music helps us understand our past and keeps our heritage alive.</p>


<h1>Pahela Baishakh</h1>

<P>Pahela Baishakh, the first day of Bangla year, is a traditional festival of Bangalee people. It is an integral part of Bangalee culture. People observe this day with great festivities. The Baishakhi Mela which is celebrated this day is perhaps the largest festival of Bangalee culture. People from all walks of life join this festival in a joyous mood.</P>

<P>The traders open new account book “Halkhata” and offer sweets to their customers. In villages, people pass the day meeting one another, giving and receiving invitations, arranging traditional games and enjoying music by local performers. Urban people try to be Bangalee at least on this day. They go to visit the park and enjoy cultural programs. Different socio-cultural organizations arrange various cultural programs to celebrate Pahela Baishakh.</P>

<P>The festivities begin at dawn from Ramana Batamul with the famous song “Esho hey Baishakh, Esho Esho” to welcome the new year. Bangla Academy, Sishu Academy, Shilpakala Academy, Bulbul Lalita Kala Academy arrange cultural programs including singing songs, arranging drama, dancing etc. Fine arts institute of Dhaka University brings out a mass procession “Mangal Shobhajatra” at the dawn of the day.</P>
