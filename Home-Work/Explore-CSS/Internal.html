    <h1>Folk Music</h1>

    <P>Folk music is a type of music that comes from regular people in a place and is passed down through generations. It’s not fancy or complex because it’s sung by everyday folks, not professional musicians. In Bangladesh, we have many types of folk music like Bhatiyali, Bhawaiya, Baul, and spiritual songs. These songs are about things like love, nature, and rural life.<br>
        <br>


        Some famous singers who contributed to folk music in Bangladesh are Lalan Shah, SirajSai, and Hason Raja. Different tribes in Bangladesh, like the Santal and Garo, also influence folk music. Folk songs often talk about social issues like poverty and inequality, as well as things beyond our everyday world.<br>
        <br>

        
        Sadly, many people are forgetting about these traditional songs, even though they’re an important part of our culture. Folk music helps us understand our past and keeps our heritage alive.</P>
